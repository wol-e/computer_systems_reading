Understanding a little bit about representation of intergers in memory. Output of running `mem` is

```
Value of a: 42
Memory addreess of a: 0x564e6f512010
Bytes occupied by a: 4
Byte representation of a: (2A000000)
```
a is an unsigned int. We assign a value of 42 to a. Then we investigate the variables memory address, the number of bytes i occupies in memory
and what those bytes actually are, in hex notation. Note that this shows my computer being little endian.
