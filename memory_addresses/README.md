Understanding a little bit about representation of intergers in memory. Output (system and state dependent) of running `mem` is

```
Value of a: 271
Memory addreess of a: 0x55af44a17010
Bytes occupied by a: 4
Byte representation of a: (0F010000)
```
a is an unsigned int. First,we assign a value to a. Then we investigate the variables memory address, the number of bytes it occupies in memory
and what those bytes actually are, in hex notation. Note that this shows my computer being little endian.
